# Llama Launching

Hi! My name is Branden Yang, and I made this game for fun during the summer of 2018 (when I was an incoming sophmore in high school).

### The link for the game on the App Store can be found here: 
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/llama-launching/id1413570758

Since idk that much about GitHub and I'm not sure how to upload large amounts of files, I've only included the Swift code files, the SpriteKit effects that I made in Xcode, and the assets (not sure if those last two are actually usable but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

Anyways, feel free to use this code, although I'm not sure how helpful it'll be since it's super unorganized lol. (And I have no intention of cleaning it up anytime soon)

If you're curious as to how I made this app, the majority of it was just googling stuff that I didn't know how to do (YouTube in particular really led me through most of the way).

Special thanks to the people who created the font and sound effects that I used (and any other free stuff I found online), and also Hitesh Choudhury who helped me with something that I forgot but I just love that guy lmao

### If you would like to use any of the assets I designed for this game, you are free to do so, but please give proper credit.
If you have any further questions regarding this, feel free to email me at llamalaunching@gmail.com
